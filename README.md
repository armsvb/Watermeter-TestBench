Watermeter Testbench

Arduino Uno is used with Screwshield and Sensor Shield to interface a number of
sensors in apparatus for test and calibration of a watermeter.

Sensors are

- FS200 flowmeter, 450 pulses per litre.
- Temperature Sensor (?)
- Solenoid operated water valve
- Water pressure sensor
- Start button
- Chronodot real-time clock based on the DS3231 RTC chip.

The watermeter used is that for the XBee-Acquisition project
