Watermeter Testbench GUI

This is a convenience program to collect incoming serial data from the
Arduino microcontroller, scale it for real-time display, and save to a file.
It also collects incoming serial date on a second serial interface to be used
by the Watermeter.

A button is provided for software start and stop of the data collection process.
