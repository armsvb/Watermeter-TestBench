Watermeter Testbench GUI

This is a convenience program to collect incoming serial data from the
Arduino microcontroller, scale it for real-time display, and save to a file.

It allows an additional stream to be included from another serial source if
needed, such as directly from the watermeter.

A button is provided to start and stop the data collection process.
